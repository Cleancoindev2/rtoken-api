# rDAI API

Quick and easy access to rDAI data. This is a free and open instance of <b>rToken-analytics</b> ([link](https://github.com/rtoken-project/rtoken-analytics)).

Acces it via `api.rdai.money`. Currently only Mainnet is supported

> If you plan to use this service heavily, or don't find what you're looking for here, you should consider using the `rToken-analytics` package directly. Not all functions are implemented here (yet).

Docs coming soon! Until then, see `server.js` for what you can call.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, both here and in rToken-analytics.
